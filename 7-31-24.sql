With around 500 pieces of equipment, the reports start to pile up, especially since it is all done on a paper system.  When equipment gets added or retired, the paperwork isnâ€™t always updated to match.  Trying to locate a specific document is even worse since the filing system isnâ€™t conducive to finding a specific report.\r\n\r\nHe also put forth the general form of solution he was looking for (but made clear he was open to other ideas): an inventory management system composed of QR codes to identify the sections and equipment items, a database that could store the reports, and a mobile application that could be used to document the equipment status and scan the QR codes.\r\n\r\nThe 4 members of Team 6 independently selected this project as their most desired project for a variety of reasons, chief among those being the desire to give back to the community, getting to have the history of working on a project we could take pride in (both personally and in job interviews), and the fact that the project already had somewhat of a pre-defined structure.  Having the basic structure already laid out meant that we could devote more time to expanding on that base; one example of such is that the team decided we would have enough time to complete both a native iOS application as well as a native Android application.\r\n\r\nOne of our hopes is that if the system catches on at the Oviedo Fire Station it can later be easily adapted for use at other stations with the same issue.  Most fire stations use the same general equipment checks at the beginning of shifts, and we have no current plans to monetize the design.  If anything, itâ€™d be a mark of pride for our system to be able to help firefighters all over.\r\n\r\nWe designed the system in such a way that there will be no cost to the fire department.

Routing out these vulnerabilities takes a significant amount of time, expertise, and resources. We aim to create a tool which can automatically locates these vulnerabilities and exponentially reduces the amount of manpower required to address them. Universal application is the core of our project. To that end, we are using exclusively attributes about the code(meta-data) rather than looking at the code itself. This approach leverages the way humans write code and therefor will be affective regardless of the coding language used. We have decided to deploy this tool and its database on a web application so that any developer with a GitHub repository and an internet connection can utilize our free and opensource tool. We are competing with services like Clockwork which analyze source code for known vulnerabilities. While code analysis will always be more accurate than our meta-data only approach, meta-data analysis has its perks. Our application will be universally applicable. Given that we require no extensive documentation on specific vulnerabilities, it is theoretically possible to discover new vulnerabilities with this approach which have yet to be specified. Our tool is 100% opensource and free to use, making it automatically competitive with any industry tool charging for the same service. \r\nTo our knowledge, this has never been attempted before. A similar approach was used for finding bugs (code deficiencies and aberrant system behavior) with some success by Dr. Elaine Weyuker who inspired this project. Due to the research nature of this project, our contribution will be a proof of concept which gets the ball rolling for further extensive development and research. As machine learning tools become more powerful in the future, so to will our platform. \r\n	The application will be very intuitive to use. We will do the legwork to train a machine learning model with the intent of drawing a correlation between meta-data and the percentage likelihood that a vulnerability is present in a file. Once our model is trained using our ground-truth database, it is deployed to the webapp for use. A user will simply submit their repository link and our model will iterate through every individual file in the repo, essentially producing a roadmap to vulnerability hotspots within their project. Ideally, the user would only need to worry about securing the 30th percentile of files which are most likely to contain vulnerabilities; greatly reducing the burden of battening down the hatches. We will store all user input data/results to make an even larger database for anyone who takes this project after us to make more complex and effective machine learning models.\r\nhttps://security-whale.web.app/dashboard','Fall',2020,1),(629,402,'Shopping Stories','Molly Kerr','molly@historyrevealed.co','The Shopping Stories database is a cost-effective, cloud-based web application database tool to help researchers discover the hidden stories of people living in 18th century Virginia.

StarCraft as a game is a very complex real-time strategy game, it features three primary archetypes or races to play as, Zerg, Terran, or Protoss, within these races it has thousands of different strategies and ways to play the game and therefore has received a massive following over its long tenure as a popular game. With its massive popularity comes a large data set that is out there known as StarData through this it is possible to completely analyze over 60,000 games of StarCraft data for use.\r\n\r\nEverglades as an RTS game has the goals of having specific unit compositions, strategies, base layouts, and more all features that are present in StarCraft which makes it the perfect Game for effective crossover data. The current overarching goal of the project is to utilize statistics, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning to study Behaviors that Lead to Wins, Losses, and other major events that can occur within the StarCraft game. The starting Objectives will be to use the database of info and start setting up some initial learning patterns given the data to focus on Wins and Losses. As the project progresses smaller objectives such as unit compositions will become an objective with setting up algorithms that make these possible.  The function of gathering all this data is overall to have a good basis for further gathering and development of data. With this starting point once the Everglades project has data that is needing to be analyzed the methodology and tools are already developed and ready to go and only need slight changes to switch from being a StarCraft data set to the everglades data.','Spring',2021,1),(678,451,'myGrowth: Your General Wellness Tracker','Student',NULL,'Combines the benefits of numerous mobile health applications into one iOS and Android application where users can cover every aspect of their health: fitness, diet, and more.

The bot will be linked to a messaging platform (i.e., Discord) and post a custom message whenever a team member makes a change to the repository.  This bot will track data from the commit itself, such as who pushed the commit, when it was pushed, and the description of the commit.\r\nâ€¢	On-Boarding Bot: This would help familiarize a user with a new repository that theyâ€™ve cloned onto their system.

As a result, quantum mechanics still seems like a work of science fiction. To address this problem, we have created an interactive simulation of the hydrogen atom model.
